# Branch Name Suggestion

A GitHub Action that suggests branch names by looking at the issues properties
like milestones and labels.

## Important note about this action

This action is designed for specific use cases related to private projects. If
its features align with your workflow, feel free to use it. However, if you're
looking for a more general and customizable solution, consider exploring other
GitHub Actions available in the marketplace that might better suit your needs.

## Features

1. Suggests branch names based on issue milestones and labels.
1. Comments the suggested branch name directly on the issue, allowing for easy
   copying and pasting.
1. Names are generated by combining the milestone title and issue number, with a
   slight variation if a "release" label is present.

## Usage

1. Create a new workflow file in your repository, e.g.,
   `.github/workflows/branch-name-suggestion.yml`.
1. Add the following content to this file:
   ```yaml
   name: Branch Name Suggestion
   on:
       issues:
           types: [milestoned]
   permissions:
       issues: write
   jobs:
       branch_name_generation:
           runs-on: ubuntu-latest
           steps:
               - name: Comment on the issue with the suggested branch name
                 uses: adrianocastro189/ghaction-branch-name-suggestion@1.0.4
                 with:
                   github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```
1. Make sure to use the most recent version of the action by checking the
   [releases page](https://github.com/adrianocastro189/ghaction-branch-name-suggestion/releases).
1. Commit and push the workflow file to your repository.
1. Now, whenever an issue is milestoned, the action will suggest a branch name
   based on the issue's properties by commenting on it.
